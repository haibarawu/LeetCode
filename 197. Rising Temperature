// 197. Rising Temperature
// Given a Weather table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.

+---------+------------------+------------------+
| Id(INT) | RecordDate(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
|       1 |       2015-01-01 |               10 |
|       2 |       2015-01-02 |               25 |
|       3 |       2015-01-03 |               20 |
|       4 |       2015-01-04 |               30 |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
For example, return the following Ids for the above Weather table:
+----+
| Id |
+----+
|  2 |
|  4 |

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT w2.Id
FROM Weather AS w1
INNER JOIN Weather AS w2
    ON w1.Temperature < w2.Temperature
    AND DATEDIFF(w2.RecordDate, w1.RecordDate) = 1
